Spectroscopy is a novel approach to observe soil properties on a soil samples efficiently. The properties are predicted based on a library of reference samples which are assessed both with wet chemistry as well as spectrometry. A common practice is to deposit the spectra of the observations as part of the data as well as a reference to the spectral library used for the prediction.
