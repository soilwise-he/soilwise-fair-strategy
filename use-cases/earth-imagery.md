[Earth imagery](./earth-imagery.md) such as satelite and drone data are increasingly used to better understand soils and their interaction with climate, landscape and crops. Imagery data is often used as a predictor of soil property distribution. Due to their size and origin imagery data is usually not deposited in formal repositories, but available from mass storage such as Google Earth Engine, Copernicus or Amazon Cloud, which can be a challenge for citation of the material.
