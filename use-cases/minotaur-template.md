- [Minotaur](./minotaur-template.md) provides a template to store soil observation data on biodiversity. The template was developed within the EJP SOIL project Minotaur to upload relevant data and metadata on soil biodiversity. It was used to collect information across EU countries on soil biodiversity to be organized in an information system developed with the OpenAdom platform (see also https://zenodo.org/records/14245502).
